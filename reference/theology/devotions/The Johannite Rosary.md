## Prayers

### Act of Gnosis [act_of_gnosis]

&#x2123; What makes us free is the Gnosis

&#x211F; Of who we were, of what we have become;
of where we were, of wherein we have been cast;
of whereto we speed, of wherefrom we are redeemed;
of what birth truly is, and of what rebirth truly is.

### Our Father [our_father]

&#x2123; Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name;
Thy kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

&#x211F; Give us this day our daily bread;
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation;
but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the Kingdom,
and the Power,
and the Glory,
Now and Forever unto the ages of ages.

Amen.

### Prayer of Saint John [saint_john]

&#x2123; O blessed Christ,
give me stillness of soul in You.

&#x211F; Let Your mighty calmness reign in me.
Guide me, O Lord of Gentleness,
Lord of Peace.

### Trio at the Cross [trio_at_the_cross]

&#x2123; Mary, Sorrowful and Inviolate Mother
John, Evangelist and Beloved Disciple
Jesus, Slain and Risen Again

&#x211F; Mary, John, Jesus. At the foot of the Cross, and Upon the Cross
We remember Christ on the Cross.
We remember the Mourning of Mary.
We remember John and the Daughters of Jerusalem.
We remember Christ Risen.
Bring us Light.

### Hail, Holy Queen [hail_holy_queen]

Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Wisdom!
Our life, our sweetness, and our hope!
To thee do we sing, awakened
children of Eve, to thee do we send
up our hope, for wholeness,
compassion and understanding.
Hear your children, most gracious advocate,
and send us sight to see; and
after this our exile show unto us the
blessed fruit of thy holy Logos;
O clement, O loving, O Holy Sophia.
Be with us, O holy Mother of God
And lead us back to our eternal home.

### O Divine Logos [o_divine_logos]

O Divine Logos,
Transform me into Yourself.
May my hands be the hands of Christ.
Grant that every faculty of my body
May serve only to glorify You.
Above all,
Give me sight to see what has always been
The Kingdom of God, without and within
That we may attain to the Holy Gnosis,
and have a share and an inheritance
with all the saints and adepti
who have pleased you since the beginning.
Transform my soul and all its powers
So that my memory, will and affection
May be the memory, will and affections
Of Christ.

### Hail Mother, Rightful Queen of Faithful Souls [hail_mother]

Hail Mother
Rightful Queen of faithful souls,
Who never erred,
Who never lied,
Follower of the rightful course,
Who never doubted
lest we should accept death
in the realm of the wrong god;
as we do not belong to this realm
and this realm is not ours -
teach us Your Gnosis
and to love what You love.
