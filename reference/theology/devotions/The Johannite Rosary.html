<h3 id="act_of_gnosis">Act of Gnosis</h3>

<p>&#x2123; What makes us free is the Gnosis</p>

<p>&#x211F; Of who we were, of what we have become;<br/>
of where we were, of wherein we have been cast;<br/>
of whereto we speed, of wherefrom we are redeemed;<br/>
of what birth truly is, and of what rebirth truly is. </p>

<h3 id="our_father">Our Father</h3>

<p>&#x2123; Our Father, who art in heaven,<br/>
hallowed be Thy name;<br/>
Thy kingdom come;<br/>
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. </p>

<p>&#x211F; Give us this day our daily bread;<br/>
and forgive us our trespasses<br/>
as we forgive those who trespass against us;<br/>
and lead us not into temptation;<br/>
but deliver us from evil.<br/>
For thine is the Kingdom,<br/>
and the Power,<br/>
and the Glory,<br/>
Now and Forever unto the ages of ages. </p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>&#x2123; O blessed Christ,<br/>
give me stillness of soul in You. </p>

<p>&#x211F; Let Your mighty calmness reign in me.<br/>
Guide me, O Lord of Gentleness,<br/>
Lord of Peace. </p>

Bring us Light. </p>

<h3 id="hail_holy_queen">Hail, Holy Queen</h3>

<p>Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Wisdom!<br/>
Our life, our sweetness, and our hope!<br/>
To thee do we sing, awakened<br/>
children of Eve, to thee do we send<br/>
up our hope, for wholeness,<br/>
compassion and understanding.<br/>
Hear your children, most gracious advocate,<br/>
and send us sight to see; and<br/>
after this our exile show unto us the<br/>
blessed fruit of thy holy Logos;<br/>
O clement, O loving, O Holy Sophia.<br/>
Be with us, O holy Mother of God<br/>
And lead us back to our eternal home. </p>

<h3 id="o_divine_logos">O Divine Logos</h3>

<p>O Divine Logos,<br/>
Transform me into Yourself.<br/>
May my hands be the hands of Christ.<br/>
Grant that every faculty of my body<br/>
May serve only to glorify You.<br/>
Above all,<br/>
Give me sight to see what has always been<br/>
The Kingdom of God, without and within<br/>
That we may attain to the Holy Gnosis,<br/>
and have a share and an inheritance<br/>
with all the saints and adepti<br/>
who have pleased you since the beginning.<br/>
Transform my soul and all its powers<br/>
So that my memory, will and affection<br/>
May be the memory, will and affections<br/>
Of Christ. </p>

<h3 id="hail_mother">Hail Mother, Rightful Queen of Faithful Souls</h3>

<p>Hail Mother<br/>
Rightful Queen of faithful souls,<br/>
Who never erred,<br/>
Who never lied,<br/>
Follower of the rightful course,<br/>
Who never doubted<br/>
lest we should accept death<br/>
in the realm of the wrong god;<br/>
as we do not belong to this realm<br/>
and this realm is not ours -<br/>
teach us Your Gnosis<br/>
and to love what You love. </p>
