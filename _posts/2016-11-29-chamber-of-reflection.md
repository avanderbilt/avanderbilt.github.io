I gave a talk at the [Austin Lodge \#12][austin_lodge] monthly Masonic education night about the tradition of the [Chamber of Reflection][slideshow] on Monday, November 28th.

"The tradition of the Chamber of Reflection in Freemasonry will be presented, with its symbolism and the expectations that may be placed upon a candidate regarding its use. The question of the place of the Chamber of Reflection in the contemporary practice of Craft Freemasonry will be discussed, as well as the applicability of a personal Chamber of Reflection and the broader practice of emblematic meditation to day-to-day life."

The slides are available [here][slideshow].
