I gave a talk at the [Austin Lodge \#12][austin_lodge] monthly Masonic education night about about [Meditation and Freemasonry][slideshow] on Monday, January 30th.

"An overview of meditation practice, sacred and philosophical, with a focus on emblematic meditation and its application to Masonic practice."

The slides are available [here][slideshow].
