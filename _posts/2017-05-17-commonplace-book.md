### Quotes

> "Whatever the reason, he did what people of his era tended to do when they had some time---he took out his notebook and his set of pens, and he put together a page-sized patchwork of his afternoon."

> "Scribbles and sketches fill each page. Personal anecdotes and hard-won lessons nestle alongside gathered material, including prayers, copied quotations and lists of spices."

> "A strange melange of diary, ledger, doodle pad, and scrapbook, these volumes---along with similar 'hodgepodges' and 'commonplace books'---served as a pattern for interior life from the 14th century onward, bringing comfort and inspiration to everyone from Thomas Jefferson to Lewis Carroll."

> "Unlike their upper-class counterparts, who mostly stuck to Latin, these tradesmen wrote in the Italian vernacular; they also were more likely to crib together all kinds of work and play into one small, portable book. They called each volume a zibaldone, Italian for 'a heap of things,' possibly after a type of mixed-up stew."

> "In Ancient Greece, Aristotle had suggested his students keep scrolls of notes from their studies, organized by subject, so that they could return at will to any topic's 'place.'"

> "Renaissance-era teachers resurfaced this idea, and by the 17th century, students at Oxford were required to keep 'commonplace books,' organized notebooks stuffed with useful texts from elsewhere."

> "This heady combination of usefulness and prestige meant that by the 19th century, pretty much every serious literary figure traveled with a notebook and pen specifically for zibaldoning."

> "The commonplace book of William Byrd II, founder of Richmond, Virginia, is full of scripture, meal logs, and 18th-century sex tips, all of which have proved fruitful to modern scholars hoping for a glimpse at colonial American life."

> "The British sailor Henry Tiffin shows up in zero history books, but filled his own book with 28 years' worth of sea shanties, ship notes, and gorgeous watercolors."

> "In fact, some media scholars argue that commonplace books and zibaldones were precursors to the Internet, which is similarly scrappy and mixed-up, rich in influences and perfectly willing to zig-zag between genres."

> "Chachra mostly reads books on her Kindle, so after she finishes one, she'll write a squib about it in her zibaldone. That way, she can feel its continued presence somewhere, even if not on a shelf. She'll do the same for films and concerts."

> "You learn about a hundred pages a day about how to live, but the book (this book) has 15 or 20 million pages." -- Giacomo Leopardi
